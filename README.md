<H2>DIY Custom EqualLogic Reporting for EMC ViPR SRM</H2>

<p><b>Thanks to an internal lab I was able to get access to an EqualLogic PS6000 series array and an ESX server to deploy an SRM server and created a sample report of real EqualLogic data that I could use to validate that the report met my customers needs.  I also documented the process for installing this customized collector (SNMP Masks, Polling Group, and Reports) which I'm sharing here for others to use.</b></p>
