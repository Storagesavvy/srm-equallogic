<H2>DIY Custom EqualLogic Reporting for EMC ViPR SRM</H2>

<p><b>I've been working on a few POCs of ViPR SRM that require reporting for EqualLogic.  While we positioned the need to do a formal Custom Reporting SOW as part of the purchase of SRM, the customers all required that we demonstrate our ability to report on EqualLogic during the POC as proof that it was possible.  Thanks to the competitive lab in Miami I was able to get access to an EqualLogic PS6000 series array and an ESX server to deploy an SRM server and created a sample report of real EqualLogic data that I could use to validate that the report met the customers needs.  I also documented the process for installing this customized collector (SNMP Masks, Polling Group, and Reports) which I'm sharing here for others to use.</b></p>
